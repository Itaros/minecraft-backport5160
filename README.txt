This is Forge/FML base coremod to backport https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/5160 

Please note that at the moment it doesn't do that completely, but major components are already ported. The reason this is important is because vanilla Minecraft tends to eat or dupe entities moving across chunk borders which is very problematic when it comes to modded gameplay with moving entities, e.g. Railcraft.
